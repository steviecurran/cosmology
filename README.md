Yields the different cosmological distances for an input redshift

Based on the standard (Lambda cold dark matter) model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model), uses the fomulae in https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999astro.ph..5116H/abstract to caluclate the co-moving, angular diameter and luminosity distances (in Mpc) for a given redshift. Also gives the look-back time and age of Universe (in Gyr).
